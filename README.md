This project is part of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree. I used a pre-trained image classifier to classify images as "dogs" or "not dogs."
The objectives of the project are:
1- To determine which image classification algorithm works best and how well is it.
2- To calculate the time taken by each algorithm to solve the classification problem.
